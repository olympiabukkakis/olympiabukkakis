Over three nights of the festival Olympia Bukkakis will moderate a programm of queer Berlin-based performers. 

With a night that merges performance art and queer pornography, Pornceptual invites all earthly beings to enter our secret porn garden. A Boschian world where the poetic and the mysterious will combine to blossom all kinds of sexual feelings. From magnificent nightmares to opium daydreams, the Garden of PORN is a place for growing pleasures and erotic delights. Through the work of various Berlin-based performers and musicians, moderated by Queen of the Heavens and of the Earth, Olympia Bukkakis, we will create an erotic forest ruled by cosmic sexual entities and supernatural creatures.

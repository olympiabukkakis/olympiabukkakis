QUEENS AGAINST BORDERS is returning to SO36 for our 10th edition! We've been putting on these shows for 4 years now and this one will be our biggest and best yet!  


With performances by:   

WIZZY  
MIKEY.  
NICKY  
HOUSE OF LIVING COLOURS  
ELINA  
MEDO   
ASIS D'ORANGE  
OLYMPIA BUKKAKIS  
JUDY LADIVINA  
THE DARVISH!  

Before the show we'll have a set from CARAMEL MAFIA and after the show OLYMPIA BUKKAKIS, queen of the sloppy transition, will have us dancing til the early hours with an international trash pop set.   
We'll also be featuring a moderated community discussion on the topic: Climate Change & Refugees  

Organised and hosted by the DARVISH and OLYMPIA BUKKAKIS.  

Queens Against Borders is a performance party building solidarity with trans and queer refugees. We aim to build a bridge between Drag, Trans and Queer Performance Artists who are Refugees and those performers who have already established spaces in the city. We provide a platform for trans and queer refugees to showcase their talent and an opportunity for other Berliners to experience an unforgettable show.  

After paying our performers and organisation team (including a solidarity rate for those with a refugee status) all profits will go towards surgery costs and other support for trans refugees.  

See you there!

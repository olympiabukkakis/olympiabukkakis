description: "Founded by Olympia Bukkakis in September 2015, Queens Against Borders is a performance party building solidarity with trans and queer refugees. Working with the Darvish since 2018, they aim to build a bridge between drag, trans and queer performers who are refugees and those performers who have already established spaces in the city. They provide a platform for trans and queer refugees to showcase their talent and an opportunity for other Berliners to experience an unforgettable show.

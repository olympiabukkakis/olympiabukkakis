Get Fucked

1.	To take into oneself the body of another  
2.	To ascend to an altered/enlightened state  
3.	A command to either improve oneself or remove oneself from a situation.  

Get Fucked is a queer performance night in Neukölln, Berlin. It is organised, curated and hosted by her Holiness, the First, Last, and Eternal Olympia Bukkakis. 

From its first incarnations in a small bar in Neukölln in July 2013, Get Fucked has grown into a performance platform that aims to build a bridge between more traditional forms of queer nightlife performance (such as drag) and performers and artists from other disciplines such as dance, installation, sound, and live art.  

It now takes place every four weeks at Kake, Ziegrastraße 11 in Neukölln with a different theme each time (Get Sophisticated, Get Even, Get Rich etc.). Check the events page for the next edition.  

Come get fucked with us. We dare you.

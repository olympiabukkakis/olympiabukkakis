Looking gorgeous makes you feel great but nothing’s more annoying than some random guy swooping in with a “dude you look awesome man” and a compulsory high five. It’s a buzz-kill that you just don’t need. But never fear: the Bukkakis Beauty Method is a simple set of techniques that keep the bad guys at bay without the need to look entirely like a second hand adult diaper.  

*Makeup Tutorial* is a video performed, written and edited by Olympia Bukkakis exploring queer performance of the self, temporal drag and looking great under hetero/cisnormative late capitalism.

Queen of the Heavens and of the Earth, Empress of Despair, and Architect of Your Eternal Suffering, Olympia Bukkakis began performing while completing a BA in social theory at Melbourne University in Australia and kick-started the local alternative drag scene with her party *Pandora’s Box*. She has collaborated with Australian queer theatre company Sisters Grimm on a number of projects including *Summertime in the Garden of Eden*. 

Since moving to Berlin in 2012, she has organised, curated, and moderated various queer performance nights including *Get Fucked*, *Fancy*, and *Apocalypse Tonight*. Since 2015 she has organised and hosted *Queens Against Borders*, a performance event in solidarity with trans and queer refugees. In recent years she has begun to perform in contemporary dance and performance contexts, performing in Jeremy Wade’s *Between Sirens* and *Human Resources* and in 2019 she completed a Masters in Solo Dance Authorship at the Inter-University Centre for Dance (HZT) in Berlin with her graduation piece *Tales From a State of Shemergency*. 

Since then she has premiered her work, *Gender Euphoria*, as part of the 2019 Tanztage festival at Sophiensaele in Berlin, as well as co-authoring *Work on Progress*, a performative manifesto with Isabel Gatzke that was presented as part of The Future is Not Enough festival at HAU Berlin. In December she co-authored *Under Pressures* with Isabel Gatzke and Camille Lacadee and this was presented as part of Im/possible Spaces at Theaterhaus Gessnerallee in Zurich. Most recently she premiered another solo work, *A Touch of the Other*, during the Riska & Resilience festival at Stophiensaele in October 2020. 

As well as performing, moderating and giving workshops, Olympia has published a number of writing pieces. *Gender Euphoria: Trans and Nonbinary Identities in Drag* was published by Bloomsbury as part of *Contemporary Drag Practices and Performers: Drag in a Changing Scene*. A polemic titled *A Case for the Abolition of Men* will soon be available through the HKW.  

Her practice is situated within, and inspired by, the tensions and intersections between queer nightlife and contemporary dance and performance.
